# tic-tac-toe
A Simple TicTacToe game in Python with a Terminal UI which uses the curses module.
Which I Basically made to Learn the Curses Module.

If you are running this,
do **pip install windows-curses** if on windows
and its pre-installed in Linux and Mac.

And at any costs dont use *Ctrl-C* to exit.
That can mess your terminal, use the provided exit option in the UI.
